Colour shadings show model predictions of the $u-r$ optical colour (top panel), $NUV-u$ colour (middle panel), and star formation rate in $M_\odot \rm{~yr}^{-1}$ (lower panel), at $t^{obs} = 12.8~\rm{Gyr}$, the mean observed redshift of the GZ2 sample (see Section \ref{qmod}). The combination of optical and NUV colours is a sensitive measure of the $\theta = [t_q, \tau]$ parameter space. Note that all models with $t > 12.8$ \rm{Gyr} are effectively un-quenched. The `kink' in the bottom panel is due to the assumption that the sSFR is constant prior to $t \sim 3~\rm{Gyr}$ ($z\sim 2.2$).}

\end{figure}

The quenched star formation history (SFH) of a galaxy can be simply modelled as an exponentially declining star formation rate (SFR) across cosmic time ($0 \leq t ~\rm{[Gyr]} \leq 13.8$) as:
\begin{equation}\label{sfh}
SFR =
\begin{cases}
i_{sfr}(t_q) & \text{if } t < t_q \\
i_{sfr}(t_q) \times exp{\left( \frac{-(t-t_{q})}{\tau}\right)} & \text{if } t > t_q 
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $t_{q}$ is the onset time of quenching, $\tau$ is the timescale over which the quenching occurs and $i_{sfr}$ is an initial constant star formation rate dependent on $t_q$.  A smaller $\tau$ value corresponds to a rapid quench, whereas a larger $\tau$ value corresponds to a slower quench. 

We assume that all galaxies formed at a time $t=0~\rm{Gyr}$ with an initial burst of star formation. The mass of this initial burst is controlled by the value of the $i_{sfr}$ which is set as the average specific SFR (sSFR) at the time of quenching $t_q$.  \citet{peng10} defined a relation (their equation 1) between the average sSFR and redshift (cosmic time, $t$) by fitting to measurements of the mean sSFR of blue star forming galaxies from SDSS, zCOSMOS and literature values at increasing redshifts \citep{Elbaz07, Daddi07}:
\begin{equation}
sSFR(m,t) = 2.5 \left( \frac{m}{10^{10} M_{\odot}} \right)^{-0.1} \left(\frac{t}{3.5 ~\rm{Gyr}}\right)^{-2.2} \rm{Gyr}^{-1}.
\end{equation}
Beyond $z \sim 2$ the characteristic SFR flattens and is roughly constant back to $z\sim6$. The cause for this change is not well understood but can be seen across similar observational data \citep{peng10, gonzalez10, bethermin12}. Motivated by these observations, the relation defined in \citet{peng10} is taken up to a cosmic time of $t=3~\rm{Gyr}~(z \sim 2.3)$ and prior to this a constant average SFR is assumed (see Figure~\ref{sfr_mass_col}). At the point of quenching, $t_{q}$, the models are defined to have a SFR which lies on this relationship for the sSFR, for a galaxy with mass, $m = 10^{10.27} M_{\odot}$ (the mean mass of the GZ2 sample; see Section~\ref{results} and Figure~\ref{sfr_mass_col}).

The SFHs of the models are shown in the middle panel, where the SFR is initially constant before quenching at time $t$ and thereafter exponentially declining with a characteristic timescale $\tau$. We set the SFR at the point of quenching to be consistent with the typical SFR of a star-forming galaxy at the quenching time, $t$ (dashed line; \citealt{peng10}). The full range of models reproduces the observed colour-colour properties of the sample (right panel); for clarity the figures show only 4 of the possible models explored in this study. Note that some of the model tracks produce colours redder than the apparent peak of the red sequence in the GZ2 subsample; however this is not the \emph{true} peak of the red sequence due to the necessity for NUV colours from GALEX.}
\label{sfr_mass_col}
\end{figure*}
  
Under these assumptions the average SFR of our models will result in a lower value than the relation defined in \citet{peng10} at all cosmic times; each galaxy only resides on the `main sequence' at the point of quenching. However galaxies cannot remain on the `main sequence' from early to late times throughout their entire lifetimes given the unphysical stellar masses and SFRs this would result in at the current epoch in the local Universe \citep{bethermin12, Heinis14}. If we were to include prescriptions for no quenching, starbursts, mergers, AGN etc. into our models we would improve on our reproduction of the average SFR across cosmic time; however we chose to initially focus on the simplest model possible.

Once this evolutionary SFR is obtained, it is convolved with the \citet{BC03} population synthesis models to generate a model SED at each time step. The observed features of galaxy spectra can be modelled using simple stellar population techniques which sum the contributions of individual, coeval, equal-metallicity stars. The accuracy of these predictions depends on the completeness of the input stellar physics. Comprehensive knowledge is therefore required of (i) stellar evolutionary tracks and (ii) the initial mass function (IMF) to synthesise a stellar population accurately. 

These stellar population synthesis (SPS) models are an extremely well explored (and often debated) area of astrophysics \citep{Maraston05, Eminian08, CGW09, falkenberg09, Chen10, Kriek10, miner11, melbourne12}. In this investigation we chose to utilise the \citet{BC03} \emph{GALEXEV} SPS models, to allow a direct comparison with S14, along with a Chabrier \citep{chabrier03} IMF, across a large wavelength range ($0.0091 < ~\lambda~\rm{[\mu m]}~ < 160 $) with solar metallically (m62 in the \citet{BC03} models; hereafter BC03).


Fluxes from stars younger than $3~$Myr in the SPS model are suppressed to mimic the large optical depth of protostars embedded in dusty formation cloud (as in S14), then filter transmission curves are applied to the fluxes to obtain AB magnitudes and therefore colours.  For a particular galaxy at an observed redshift, $z$, we define the observed time, $t^{obs}$ for that galaxy using the standard cosmological conversion between redshift and time. We utilise the SFH models at this observed time for each individual galaxy to compare the predicted model and observed colours directly.


Figure~\ref{pred} shows these predicted optical and NUV colours at a time of $t^{obs} = 12.8 ~\rm{Gyr}$ (the average observed time of the Galaxy Zoo 2 sample, $z \sim 0.076$) provided by the exponential SFH model. These predicted colours will be referred to as $d_{c,p}(t_{q}, \tau, t^{obs})$, where c=\{opt,NUV\} and p = predicted. The SFR at a time of $t^{obs}=12.8~\rm{Gyr}$ is also shown in Figure~\ref{pred} to compare how this correlates with the predicted colours. The $u-r$ predicted colour shows an immediate correlation with the SFR, however the $NUV-u$ colour is more sensitive to the value of $\tau$ and so is ideal for tracing any recent star formation in a population . At small $\tau$ (rapid quenching timescales) the $NUV-u$ colour is insensitive to $t_{q}$, whereas at large $\tau$ (slow quenching timescales) the colour is very sensitive to $t_{q}$. Together the two colours are ideal for tracing the effects of $t_{q}$ and $\tau$ in a population. 

We stress here that this model is not a fully hydrodynamical simulation, it is a simple model built in order to test the understanding of the evolution of galaxy populations. These models are therefore not expected to accurately determine the SFH of every galaxy in the GZ2 sample, in particular galaxies which have not undergone any quenching. In this case the models described above can only attribute a constant star formation rate to these  unquenched galaxies. In reality, there are many possible forms of SFH that a galaxy can take, a few of which have been investigated in previous literature; starbursts \citep{Canalizo01}, a power law \citep{Glazebrook03}, single stellar populations \citep{Trager00, Sanchez06, Vazdekis10} and metallicity enrichment \citep{deLucia14}. Incorporating these different SFHs along with prescriptions for mergers and a reinvigoration of star formation post quench into our models is a possible future extension to this work once the results of this initial study are well enough understood to permit additional complexity to be added.

\section{Probabilistic Fitting Methods}

In order to achieve robust conclusions we conduct a Bayesian analysis \citep{Sivia, mackay03} of our SFH models in comparison to the observed GZ2 sample data. This approach requires consideration of all possible combinations of $\theta \equiv (t_{q}, \tau)$. Assuming that all galaxies formed at $t=0~\rm{Gyr}$ with an initial burst of star formation, we can assume that the `age' of each galaxy in the GZ2 sample is equivalent to an observed time, $t^{obs}_{k}$. We then use this  `age' to calculate the predicted model colours at this cosmic time for a given combination of $\theta$: $d_{c,p}(\theta_k, t^{obs}_{k})$ for both optical and NUV $(c={opt,NUV})$ colours. We can now directly compare our model colours with the observed GZ2 galaxy colours, so that for a single galaxy $k$ with optical ($u-r$) colour, $d_{opt, k}$ and NUV ($NUV-u$) colour, $d_{NUV,k}$, the likelihood $P(d_{k}|\theta_k, t^{obs}_{k})$ is:


\begin{equation}\label{like}
P(d_{k}|\theta_k, t^{obs}_{k}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_{opt, k}^2}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_{NUV, k}^2}} \\ \exp{\left[ - \frac{(d_{opt, k} - d_{opt, p}(\theta_k, t_{k}^{obs}))^2}{\sigma_{opt, k}^2} \right]} \\ \exp{\left[ - \frac{(d_{NUV, k} - d_{NUV, p}(\theta_k, t_{k}^{obs}))^2}{\sigma_{NUV, k}^2} \right]}.
\end{equation}


We have assumed that $P(d_{opt}|\theta_k, t^{obs}_{k})$ and $P(d_{NUV}|\theta_k, t^{obs}_{k})$ are independent of each other and that the errors on the observed colours are also independent. To obtain the probability of each combination of $\theta$ values \underline{given} the GZ2 data: $P(\theta_k|d_k, t^{obs})$, i.e. how likely is a single SFH model given the observed colours of a single GZ2 galaxy, we utilise Bayes' theorem:
 \begin{equation}\label{big}
P(\theta_k|d_k, t^{obs}) = \frac{P(d_k|\theta_k, t^{obs})P(\theta_k)}{\int P(d_k |\theta_k, t^{obs})P(\theta_k) d\theta_k}.
\end{equation}
We assume a flat prior on the model parameters so that:
\begin{equation}\label{prior}
P(\theta_k) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } 0 \leq t_q ~\rm{[Gyr]}~ \leq 13.8 ~  \text{ and } ~ 0 \leq \tau  ~\rm{[Gyr]}~ \leq 4\\
0 & \text{otherwise.} \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

As the denominator of Equation~\ref{big} is a normalisation factor, comparison between likelihoods for two different SFH models (i.e., two different combinations of $\theta_k = [t_q, \tau]$) is equivalent to a comparison of the numerators. Calculation of $P(\theta_k|d_k, t^{obs})$  for any $\theta$ is possible given galaxy data from the GZ2 sample. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC; \citealt{mackay03, emcee13, GW10}) provides a robust comparison of the likelihoods between $\theta$ values; here we choose \emph{emcee},\footnote{\url{emcee13.iel.fm/emcee/}} a Python implementation of an affine invariant ensemble sampler by \cite{emcee13}.

This method allows for a more efficient exploration of the parameter space by avoiding those areas with low likelihood. A large number of `walkers' are started at an initial position where the likelihood is calculated; from there they individually `jump' to a new area of parameter space. If the likelihood in this new area is greater (less) than the original position then the `walkers' accept (reject) this change in position. Any new position then influences the direction of the  `jumps' of other walkers. This is repeated for the defined number of steps after an initial `burn-in' phase. \emph{emcee} returns the positions of these `walkers', which are analogous to the regions of high probability in the model parameter space. The model outlined above has been coded using the \emph{Python} programming language into a package named \starpy ~which has been made freely available to download\footnote{\url{github.com/zooniverse/starpy}}. An example output from this Python package for a single galaxy from the GZ2 sample in the red sequence is shown in Figure~\ref{one_example}. The contours show the positions of the `walkers' in the Markov Chain which are analogous to the areas of high probability.

In each case \starpy ~succeeds in locating the true parameter values within the degeneracies of the star formation history model.}
\label{test_mosaic}
\end{figure}

In order to test that \starpy ~can find the correct quenching model for a given observed colour, 25 synthesised galaxies were created with known SFHs (i.e. known values of $\theta$) from which optical and NUV colours were generated. These were input into \starpy ~ to ensure that the known values of $\theta$ were reproduced, within error, for each of the 25 synthesised galaxies. Figure~\ref{test_mosaic} shows the results for each of these 25 synthesised galaxies, with the known values of $\theta$ shown by the red lines. In some cases this red line does not coincide with the peak of the distribution shown in the histograms for one parameter, however in all cases the intersection of the red lines is within the sample contours. 

We find peaks in the histograms across all areas of the parameter space in both dimensions of $[t, \tau]$, this ensures that the results presented in Figures~\ref{red_s},~\ref{green_v} \&~\ref{blue_c} arise due to a superposition of extended probability distributions, as opposed to a bimodal distribution of probability distributions across all galaxies.

Considering the size of the sample in this investigation of $126,316$ galaxies total, a three dimensional look up table (in observed time, quenching time and quenching rate) was generated using the star formation history function in \starpy ~to speed up the run time. 

We wish to consider the model parameters for the populations of galaxies across the colour magnitude diagram for both smooth and disc galaxies, therefore we run the \starpy ~package on each galaxy in the GZ2 sample. This was extremely time consuming; for each combination of $\theta$ values which \emph{emcee} proposes, a new SFH must be built, prior to convolving it with the BC03 SPS models at the observed age and then predicted colours calculated from the resultant SED. For a single galaxy this takes up to 2 hours on a typical desktop machine for long Markov Chains. A look-up table was therefore generated at $50 ~t^{obs}$, for $100 ~t_{quench}$ and $100 ~\tau$ values; this was then interpolated over for a given observed galaxy's age and proposed $\theta$ values at each step in the Markov Chain. This ensures that a single galaxy takes approximately 2 minutes to run on a typical desktop machine. Figure~\ref{lookup} shows an example of how using the look up table in place of the full function does not affect the results to a significant level. Table~\ref{median_lu} quotes the median walker positions (the 50th percentile of the Bayesian probability distribution) along with their $\pm 1\sigma$ ranges for both methods in comparison to the true values specified to test \starpy. The uncertainties incorporated into the quoted values by using the look up table are therefore minimal with a maximum $\Delta = 0.043$.

Using this lookup table, each of the $126,316$ total galaxies in the GZ2 sample was run through \starpy ~on multiple cores of a computer cluster to obtain the Markov Chain positions (analogous to $P(\theta_k|d_k)$) for each galaxy, $k$ (see Figure~\ref{one_example}). In each case the Markov Chain consisted of $100$ `walkers' which took $400$ steps in the `burn-in' phase and $400$ steps thereafter, at which point the MCMC acceptance fraction was checked to be within the range $0.25 < f_{acc} < 0.5$ (which was true in all cases). Due to the Bayesian nature of this method, a statistical test on the results is not possible; the output is probabilistic in nature across the entirety of the parameter space.

These individual galaxy positions are then combined to visualise the areas of high probability in the model parameter space across a given population (e.g. the green valley).

\label{discardnum}
\end{table*}

We discard walker positions returned by \starpy~ with a corresponding probability of $P(\theta_k|d_k) < 0.2$ in order to exclude galaxies which are not well fit by the quenching model; for example blue cloud galaxies which are still star forming will be poorly fit by a quenching model (see Section~\ref{qmod}). This raises the issue of whether we exclude a significant fraction of our galaxy sample and whether those galaxies reside in a specific location of the colour-magnitude. The fraction of galaxies which had all or more than half of their walker positions discarded due to low probability are shown in Table \ref{discardnum}. Using this constraint, $2.4\%$, $7.0\%$ and $5.4\%$ of green, red and blue galaxies respectively had \emph{all} of their walker positions discarded. 

This is not a significant fraction of either population, therefore this shows that the \starpy~ module is effective in fitting the majority of galaxies and that this method of discarding walker positions ensures that poorly fit galaxies are removed from the analysis of the results. Figure \ref{discarded} shows that these galaxies with discarded walker positions are also scattered across the optical-NUV colour-colour diagram and therefore \starpy ~is also effective in fitting galaxies across this entire plane.

\end{figure}



The Markov Chain positions are then binned and weighted by their corresponding logarithmic posterior probability $\log [P(\theta_k|d_k)]$, provided by the \emph{emcee} package, to further emphasise the features and differences between each population in the visualisation. The GZ2 data also provides uniquely powerful continuous measurements of a galaxy's morphology, therefore we utilise the user vote fractions to obtain separate model parameter distributions for both smooth and disc galaxies. This is obtained by also weighting by the morphology vote fraction when the binned positions are summed. We stress that this portion of the methodology is a non-Bayesian visualisation of the combined individual galaxy results for each population.

For example, the galaxy shown in Figure~\ref{one_example} would contribute almost evenly to both the smooth and disc parameters due to the GZ2 vote fractions. Since galaxies with similar vote fractions contain both a bulge and disc component, this method is effective in incorporating intermediate galaxies which are thought to be crucial to the morphological changes between early- and late-type galaxies. It was the consideration of these intermediate galaxies which was excluded from the investigation by S14.
