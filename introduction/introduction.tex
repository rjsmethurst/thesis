\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:intro}

Understanding the physical processes which shaped our Universe is the fundamental goal of all fields in Astrophysics. A theory of the Universe must describe how it evolved from the primordial soup of matter present just after the Big Bang to the multitude of galaxy properties we see today. 

At the time of writing, the most widely accepted model is the $\Lambda$CDM ($\Lambda$- cold dark matter) model which describes a flat Universe made of only $\sim5\%$ baryonic (``normal'') matter, $\sim26\%$ cold dark matter and $\sim69\%$ dark energy \citep{planck16}. In such a Universe, tiny quantum fluctuations in the early Universe grow with time, becoming overdense and lay the foundations for galaxy formation \citep{guth82, hawking82, linde82, starobinsky82}. Given the relatively small fraction of baryonic matter in the Universe, its gravitational contribution to this process is often neglected, greatly simplifying the problem. Structure in simulations is then observed to form hierarchically \citep{press74, gott75, white78, aarseth79, gott79, turner79, efstathiou81, davis85}. At the overdense regions in the early Universe, matter collapses dissipationally under its own gravity forming a dark matter `halo', which then grows through smooth accretion and mergers of other halos to produce the large scale structure of galaxy filaments, clusters and voids we observe today \citep[see comprehensive review by][]{frenk12}. 

Adding in the complex localised baryonic physics into this picture however, complicates matters. Galaxies are, unfortunately, not just simple smooth dark matter halos; they are thought to start life when baryons cool and condense at the centre of a dark matter halo. Further accretion of circum-nuclear gas then forms a rotating disc, within which stars will form as hydrogen gas coalesces and a galaxy is born. From this moment a galaxy will evolve, its shape changing depending on its encounters (or lack thereof) with other galaxies. 

Today we observe galaxies of a multitude of shapes, or morphology, across all redshift ranges. \cite{hubble36}  was the first to classify galaxies based on their shape, producing the widely adopted `tuning fork diagram', now known as the Hubble sequence and shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hubble}. Hubble noticed that galaxies could by broadly categorised as either elliptical in shape or as a disc with spiral arms and/or barred structures. He referred to these categories as early-types (and put them to the left of his diagram, in keeping with time axis conventions) and late types respectively, as he thought that as galaxies evolved they developed spiral structure. However, as discussed above, cosmological studies have concluded that galaxies start life as a rotating gas disc and so instead, Hubble's diagram is often read from right to left. Connecting this picture of pure gas disc galaxies in their infancy, with this plethora of galaxy structure we see today, is the focus of this thesis.

However, the structure alone is not enough to describe a galaxy's evolution. The magnitude (used as a proxy for stellar mass), star formation rate (SFR), metallicity (Z) and environment are all crucial to describing a galaxy's current state. By studying these galaxy properties, insight into the processes which govern galaxy evolution can be gained.

Large scale surveys of galaxies have firstly revealed a bimodality in the optical colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) of galaxies finding two distinct populations (see Figure~\ref{fig:cmdbaldry}); one at relatively low mass, with blue optical colours and another at relatively high mass, with red optical colours \citep{Baldry04, Baldry06, Willmer06, ball08, Brammer09}. These populations were dubbed the `blue cloud' and `red sequence' respectively \citep{Chester64, bower92, Driver06, Faber07}.  The sparsely populated colour space between these two populations was dubbed the  `green valley'.

A lower magnitude corresponds to a higher mass and a large $u-r$ value corresponds to a redder colour.}
\label{fig:cmdbaldry}
\end{figure}


The majority of disc galaxies were found in the blue cloud and the majority of ellipticals on the red sequence, with colour often used as a proxy for morphology. The Galaxy Zoo project \citep{lintott08, Lintott11}, which produced morphological classifications for a million galaxies, helped to confirm that this colour bimodality is not entirely morphology driven \citep{Strat01, Salim07, Sch07, CHV08, Bamford09, Skibba09}, detecting larger numbers of spiral galaxies in the red sequence \citep{masters10c} and elliptical galaxies in the blue cloud \citep{Sch09} than had previously been detected.

Secondly large galaxy surveys revealed that star forming galaxies are also observed to lie on a well defined `star forming sequence' (SFS) in the stellar mass vs. star formation rate (SFR) plane \citep{brinchmann04, Salim07, daddi07}. The majority of blue cloud galaxies are found to lie on this SFS with the majority of the red sequence lying well below it with very low SFRs. The intermediate colours of the green valley have therefore been interpreted as evidence of recent suppression of star formation \citep[SF;][]{Salim07}. This suppression of SF and subsequent transition of a galaxy from blue cloud to red sequence must therefore also be intrinsically tied with a possible (but not necessary) change in morphology from a disc galaxy to an elliptical galaxy.

A driver of this morphological change is thought to be the density of the galaxy environment. Due to the hierarchical nature of structure formation in $\Lambda$-CDM, galaxies are often found huddled together in groups \citep{zwicky38, zwicky52, abell58}, all sharing one large dark matter halo (groups with 100 or more galaxies are referred to as clusters \citealt{bower04}). Conversely some galaxies are found isolated from others in less dense environments (often referred to as the field), either because they are fossil groups \citep[where all members have eventually merged][]{ponman94, jones00, jones03} or have truly been isolated for their entire lifetimes. This environmental density is found to be correlated not only with morphology \citep[][and see Figure~\ref{fig:dressler}]{dressler80, smail97, poggianti99, postman05, Bamford09}, but also colour \citep{butcher78, pimbblet02}, quenched galaxy fraction \citep{kauffmann03, Baldry06, peng12, darvish16} and SFR \citep{gomez03} suggesting that the environment may drive this transition from blue cloud to red sequence.

\label{fig:dressler}
\end{figure}

Green valley galaxies have therefore long been thought of as the `crossroads' of galaxy evolution, a transition population between the two main galactic stages of the star forming blue cloud and the `dead' red sequence \citep{Bell04, Wyder07, Schim07, Martin07, Faber07, Mendez11, Gonc12, schawinski14, Pan14}. This transition is theorised to occur on rapid timescales, otherwise there would be an accumulation of galaxies residing in the green valley, rather than an accumulation in the red sequence as is observed \citep{Arnouts07, Martin07}.

I will refer to this suppression of a galaxy's SFR as \emph{quenching} and processes which can cause this suppression as \emph{quenching mechanisms}. By studying these galaxies which are quenching, having just left the SFS sequence, the mechanisms governing galaxy evolution, including both the suppression of SF and the possible transformation of galaxy structure, can be probed. 

\section{Possible quenching mechanisms}\label{sec:quenchmech}

There are many theorised mechanisms which can cause quenching. They are often referred to as either \emph{internal} mechanisms (caused by the galaxy's \emph{nature}) or \emph{external} mechanisms (caused by the way the galaxy is \emph{nurtured}). The properties of a galaxy and its environment are often thought to control which mechanisms will affect a galaxy throughout its lifetime and subsequently affect the morphology. 

%There have been many previous theories for the initial triggers of these quenching mechanisms, including negative feedback from AGN \citep{diMatteo05, Martin07, Nandra07, Sch07}, mergers \citep{Darg10a, Cheung12, Barro13}, supernovae winds \citep{MFB12}, cluster interactions \citep{Coil08, Mendez11, Fang13} and secular evolution \citep{masters10c, masters11a, Mendez11}. By investigating the \emph{amount} of quenching that has occurred in the blue cloud, green valley and red sequence; and by comparing the amount across these three populations, I can apply some constraints to these theories. 
\subsection{Internal Quenching Mechanisms}\label{sec:intquench}

\subsubsection{AGN feedback as a quenching mechanism}\label{sec:agnquench}

An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is an actively growing supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy. Feedback from an AGN is one of the most investigated mechanisms of quenching due to the tight correlations between properties of galaxies and their black holes \citep{magorrian98, marconi03, haringrix04}. This implies that the formation energy of the black hole and galaxy are coupled, leading to a co-evolution. This suggests that changes in the SFR and structure of a galaxy could also be tied to  black hole activity. 

The output of energetic material and radiation generated by the accretion onto the black hole is theorised to either heat or expel gas needed for SF in a galaxy, causing a quench. AGN feedback was first suggested as a mechanism for regulating star formation due to the results of simulations wherein galaxies could grow to unrealistic stellar masses \citep{silk98, Bower06, Croton06, somerville08}. Without a prescription for the effects of AGN feedback, the shape of the galaxy luminosity function could therefore not be matched at the high luminosity end \citep{baugh98, baugh05, kauffmann99a, kauffmann99b, somerville01, kitzbichler06}. A similar problem was also encountered at the low end of the luminosity function, which was rectified by the inclusion of the effects of supernova wind feedback \citep{dekel86, powell11}. This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:lumfuncpic} taken from \cite{silk12}. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering{
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{introduction/silk_mamon_LF.pdf}}
\caption[Illustration of the mismatch between theoretical and observed luminosity function from Silk \& Mamon (2012)]{Cartoon of the role of feedback in modifying the observed luminosity function of galaxies with respect to theoretical predictions. Supernova winds are thought to be responsible at the low mass end, with AGN feedback responsible at the high mass end. Figure 1 in \cite{silk12}.}
\label{fig:lumfuncpic}
\end{figure}

Indirect observational evidence has now been found for both positive and negative feedback in various systems (see the comprehensive review from \citealt{fabian12}). The strongest of which is the indirect evidence that the largest fraction of AGN are found in the green valley \citep{cowie08, Hickox09, schawinski10a}, suggesting a link between AGN activity and the process which moves a galaxy from the blue cloud to the red sequence. However, concrete statistical evidence for the effect of AGN feedback on the host galaxy population has so far been elusive.


\subsubsection{Mass quenching}\label{sec:massquench}
Mass quenching is the process by which a galaxy, independent of its environment, uses up its available gas for star formation via the Kennicutt-Schmidt law \citep{schmidt59, kennicutt98} and consequently grows in mass. As it does so there is less gas available for SF, and so in effect quenches itself \citep{peng12}. This is thought to be the dominant mechanism for isolated galaxies in the field \citep{kormendy04}. However, it is also thought that as a galaxy infalls in to a group or cluster over long timescales, gas reservoirs can be depleted via this mass quenching process \citep{peng12}.
 
\subsubsection{Morphological quenching}\label{sec:moprhquench}
Morphological quenching (or `secular' quenching, referring to slow, non-violent processes) is the process by which the internal structure of a galaxy can have a negative impact on its own SFR\footnote{Essentially shooting itself in the foot.}. This is theorised to occur in galaxies hosting bars; the bar funnels gas to the centre of the galaxy \citep{athanassoula92a} where it is exhausted by star formation effectively quenching the galaxy \citep{zurita04, sheth05}. This process is thought to be responsible for large numbers of red spirals and supported by observations of increasing bar fraction with red colours \citep{masters11a}. 

This process is also theorised to be caused by bulges \citep{bluck14} whereby the large gravitational potential of the bulge prevents the disc from collapsing and forming stars \citep{Fang13}. Recent observational evidence from \citep{hart16} also suggests that spiral structure can also cause morphological quenching. \citeauthor{hart16} propose that many armed spiral structures can trigger galaxy wide starbursts thereby rapidly using up gas for future star formation; similarly two armed spirals are observed with redder colours, suggesting that this spiral phase is much longer lived and may funnel gas into the centre of the galaxy to be exhausted in star formation over longer timescales.  
  
\subsection{External Quenching Mechanisms}\label{sec:extquench}
  
\subsubsection{Mergers as a quenching mechanism}\label{sec:mergersquench}

Major mergers have been intrinsically linked to the formation of elliptical galaxies since \citet{toomre72} showed this was possible with a simulation of the merger of two equal mass disc galaxies. Since $\Lambda$-CDM relies on the idea of hierarchical structure formation through the merger of dark matter halos for its description of galaxy formation, it also follows that galaxy evolution should be further influenced by mergers. 

The hypothesis is as follows; when two galaxies merge, the influx of cold gas funnelled by the forces in the interaction often results in energetic starbursts \citep{mihos94, mihos96, hopkins06d, hopkins08a, hopkins08b, snyder11, hayward14, sparre16}, which can exhaust the gas required for star formation, effectively quenching the post-merger remnant. This remnant galaxy will also have formed a dynamically hot bulge through the dissipation of angular momentum in the merger \citep{toomre77, walker96, kormendy04, hopkins11c, martig12}. The mass ratio of the two galaxies merging is thought to effect the size of the bulge that is formed in the remnant \citep{cox08, hopkins09c, tonini16}, with the most massive major mergers with a 1:1 mass ratio producing fully elliptical galaxies \citep{toomre72, barnes96, mihos96, kauffmann96, pontzen16}.

Such a scenario is also intrinsically linked to the triggering of an AGN \citep{sanders88, dimatteo05, hopkins09a, treister12} and many studies have focussed on investigating the growth of black holes due to mergers \citep[e.g.][]{veilleux02, bellovary13, ellison13, medling15, gabor16}. Simulations of mergers with AGN have lead many to believe that a merger which triggered both a starburst and an AGN can quench a galaxy in extremely rapid timescales \citep{springel05b, bell06}. Recent simulations have also suggested that feedback from the triggered AGN (see Section \ref{sec:agnquench}) is necessary to fully remove (or heat) all the available gas, otherwise the SFR will recover back to the SFS post-merger \citep{pontzen16, sparre16}. 

\subsubsection{Environment driven quenching}\label{sec:envquench}

The environment of a galaxy has long been considered a key  \emph{nurturing} aspect of galaxy evolution. Correlations of galaxy morphology \citep{dressler80, smail97, poggianti99, postman05, Bamford09}, colour \citep{butcher78, pimbblet02} and the quenched galaxy fraction \citep{kauffmann03, Baldry06, peng12, darvish16} with the environmental density all suggest that the environment is in some way responsible for the build up of the red sequence through quenching. 

The proposed quenching mechanisms under the umbrella of environmental quenching are numerous and varied. Together with the typical gravitational galaxy-galaxy interactions \citep{moore96} expected to be more frequent in a dense environment, environmental quenching also includes hydrodynamic interactions occurring between the cold inter stellar medium (ISM) of the in-falling galaxy and the hot intergalactic medium (IGM) of the group or cluster. Such hydrodynamic interactions include ram pressure stripping \citep{gunngott72}, viscous stripping \citep{nulsen82}, and thermal evaporation \citep[a rapid rise in temperature of the ISM due to contact with the IGM;][]{cowie77}. Another such process is starvation \citep{larson80} which can remove the outer galaxy halo cutting off the star formation gas supply to a galaxy. Preprocessing occurs when all of the above mechanisms take place in a group of galaxies which then merges with a larger group or cluster \citep{dressler04}. 

The most likely candidate (and therefore the most studied) mechanism for the cause of the environmental density-morphology and SFR relations is ram pressure stripping \citep[RPS;][]{abadi99, poggianti99}. However, there has been mounting evidence that RPS may not be as effective as a quenching mechanism as first thought \citep{emerick16, fillingham16}, therefore investigations of other environmentally driven quenching mechanisms are having a recent resurgence \citep[e.g.][]{bialas15, peng15, smith15b, hahn16, maier16, paccagnella16, roberts16, vandevoort16}. 

\section{Using star formation histories to investigate quenching}\label{sec:invquench}

% previous work
% using SFHs
% the benefits of SPSs

In order to understand how a galaxy is quenched, the star formation history (SFH) is often modelled, i.e. how galaxy stellar populations change with time. This approach requires the inference of the global SFH of a galaxy from a its current stellar population. While in nearby galaxies it is possible to observe resolved stellar populations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to pinpoint the main sequence turn off (an indicator of the age of a stellar population) on the Hertzsprung Russel diagram,this is not possible in more distant galaxies. Instead, reliance is placed upon the correlation between the integrated total light of a galaxy and its SFH \citep{searle73}. Many studies have employed this technique using either photometric broadband colours or spectral data as indicators of the integrated SFH \citep[for example][]{deJong96, madau98, kauffmann03, dressler04, macarthur04, Martin07, perez11, sanchez11, mcdermid15}. However, this technique is sensitive to the degeneracies between age and metallicity \citep{worthey94} and the effects of dust \citep{ganda09, pastrav13} on the integrated light. 

The turn of the millennium therefore saw the development of full spectral energy density (SED) fitting codes to infer the SFH (without having to make any prior assumptions on its form) such as \textsc{moped} \citep{heavens00}, \textsc{starlight} \citep{cidfernandes05}, \textsc{vespa} \citep{tojeiro07}, and more recently \textsc{firefly} \citep{wilkinson15}. In the absence of spectral data however, broadband colours are still effective at inferring the global SFHs of galaxies, especially when wavebands across the spectrum, such as ultra-violet, optical and infrared colours, are used simultaneously \citep{madau98}. 

This method is achieved by modelling the observed spectrum of a galaxy using a combination of spectra of simple stellar populations (SSP) at various ages. SSPs assume stars are coeval and form with the same metallicity and comprehensive knowledge of stellar evolutionary tracks and initial mass functions \citep[IMF;][]{salpeter55, chabrier03} are therefore needed to calculate the spectrum of a SSP at a given age \citep{chen10, kriek10}. Luckily, some astronomers have made the study of these SSPs their life's work \citep[for example]{BC03, Maraston05, vazquez05, CGW09}, therefore once an IMF and a SFH function have been assumed, the SED of a model galaxy can be predicted at any point in its history \citep{chen10}. Whilst the choice of an IMF and metallicity of a SSP will affect the output SED \citep{CGW09, kriek10}, the choice of the functional form of the SFH will have the greatest impact. 

Many possible forms for global galaxy SFHs have been assumed in previous studies, including an exponential decline \citep{tinsley72, gavazzi02, weiner06, Martin07, noeske07, kriek10,  schawinski14, hart16}, the extended (or delayed) exponential model \citep{gavazzi02, oemler13, simha14}, a Gaussian distribution \citep{feuillet16} or a log normal distribution \citep{gladders13, abramson16}. These models are by no means a perfect description of a galaxy's SFH \citep{lee10, boquien14, smith15}, as they generalise the localised bursts of SF across a galaxy's lifetime into a global SFH, but they still allow some insight to be gained on the complex processes responsible for the SFHs seen across the galaxy population. 

\section{Data}\label{sec:data}

In the following section I describe the data sources for the colours and morphologies used throughout this study for the galaxy sample described in Section~\ref{sec:defsample}

\subsection{Sloan Digital Sky Survey}\label{sec:sdssintro}

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; \citealt{york00}) Data Release 8 \citep{Aihara11}, provides publicly available optical magnitudes across $5$ broadband filters, $ugriz$ for over 1 million galaxies in their `main galaxy' sample. Here I utilise the Petrosian magnitudes, {\tt petroMag}, values for the $u$ ($3,543\rm{\AA}$) and $r$ ($6,231\rm{\AA}$) wavebands provided by the SDSS pipeline. Spectral data is available for a significant proportion of the SDSS main galaxy sample but the spectral fibre is a set size. Therefore across a population of galaxies the fibre will cover varying amounts of galaxies at different distances and of different sizes. Therefore the usual spectral star formation indicators cannot be utilised in this study as they will not provide an estimate of the total SFR of a galaxy. 

Magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction \citep{Oh11} by applying the \citet{Cardelli89} law, giving a typical correction of $u-r \sim 0.05$. K-corrections are also adopted to $z=0.0$ and absolute magnitudes obtained from the NYU-VAGC \citep{Blanton05, padmanabhan08, blanton07}, giving a typical $u-r$ correction of $\sim 0.15$ mag. The change in the $u-r$ colour due to both corrections therefore ranges from $\Delta u-r \sim 0.2$ at low redshift, increasing up to $\Delta u-r \sim 1.0$ at $z \sim 0.25$, which is consistent with the expected k-corrections shown in Figure 15 of \citet{blanton07}. These corrections were calculated by \citet{Bamford09} for a subset of galaxies in the SDSS survey. These corrections are a crucial aspect of this work since a $\Delta u-r \sim 1.0$ can cause a galaxy to change whether it is class as blue cloud, green valley or red sequence.

Star formation rates and stellar masses, where available, were obtained from the MPA-JHU catalog \citep{kauffmann03, brinchmann04}. I used the average values, \textsc{avg sfr} and \textsc{avg mass}, which are corrected for aperture effects and extinction.

\subsection{Galaxy Evolution Explorer}\label{sec:galexintro}

The Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX; \citealt{Martin05}) images galaxies simultaneously in two broadband filters: both the far ultra-violet (FUV) with an effective wavelength of $1,516\rm{\AA}$ and in the NUV with an effective wavelength of $2,267\rm{\AA}$. GALEX sources were matched with a search radius of $1''$ to the SDSS data in right ascension and declination. The {\tt auto} magnitudes provided by the GALEX pipeline are used in this study (for a discussion of aperture bias between different surveys see \citealt{hill11}). All magnitudes are k-corrected and extinction corrected as described in Section~\ref{sec:sdssintro}.

\subsection{Galaxy Zoo}\label{sec:GZ}

Galaxy Zoo (GZ) is a citizen science project enlisting the help of thousands of members of the public to voluntarily classify SDSS galaxy images online\footnote{\url{http://galaxyzoo.org}}. The first version of GZ classified just under 1 million SDSS galaxy images as either ellipticals, spirals or mergers within approximately 6 months of launch \citep{lintott08, Lintott11}. In the second version, GZ2 \citep{GZ2}, users were asked to make more detailed morphological classifications of $304, 022$ images from the SDSS DR8 (a subset of those classified in the first Galaxy Zoo; GZ1). These images were all classified by \emph{at least} 17 independent users, with the mean number of classifications standing at $\sim42$. GZ is now in its ninth year of classifying and its fifth incarnation, after classifying images from Hubble Space Telescope Legacy surveys in GZ:Hubble \citep{willett16} and the CANDELS survey galaxies in GZ:CANDELS \citep{simmons16}. At the time of writing, images from the DeCALS\footnote{\url{http://legacysurvey.org/}} survey and Illustrius simulation \citep{vogelsberger14, genel14} are being classified by users. 

\begin{figure}
\centering{
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{introduction/gz2_tree.pdf}}
\caption[GZ2 classification decision tree]{Flowchart of the classification tree for GZ2, beginning at the top with Task 0. Tasks are colour-coded by their relative depths in the decision tree with tasks in green, blue and purple respectively one, two or three steps below branching points in the decision tree.}
\label{fig:gztree}
\end{figure}

Since GZ2, all projects have collected classification data via a multi-step decision tree, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gztree}.  Each individual step in a tree is a \emph{task}, which consists of a \emph{question} with a finite number of possible \emph{answers}. The selection of an answer is called the user's \emph{vote}. The first task of GZ2 asks users to choose whether a galaxy is mostly smooth, is featured and/or has a disc or is a star/artefact. Unlike other tasks further down the decision tree, every user who classifies a galaxy image will complete this task (others, such as whether the galaxy has a bar, is dependent on a user having first classified it as a featured galaxy). Therefore the most statistically robust classifications are available at this level.

% The Galaxy Zoo 2 (GZ2) project consists of $304, 022$ images from the SDSS DR8 (a subset of those classified in Galaxy Zoo 1; GZ1) all classified by \emph{at least} 17 independent users, with the mean number of classifications standing at $\sim42$. The GZ2 sample is more robust than the GZ1 sample and provides more detailed morphological classifications, including features such as bars, the number of spiral arms and the ellipticity of smooth galaxies. It is for these reasons I use the GZ2 sample, as opposed to the GZ1, allowing for further investigation of specific galaxy classes in the future. 

The classifications from users produces a vote fraction for each galaxy; for example if 80 of 100 people thought a galaxy was featured and/or had a disc, whereas 20 out of 100 people thought the same galaxy was mostly smooth (i.e. elliptical), that galaxy would have raw vote fractions $p_{sd} = 0.8$ and $p_{d} = 0.2$. In this example this galaxy would be included in the \emph{`clean'} disc sample ($p_d \geq 0.8$) according to \cite{GZ2} and would be considered a late-type galaxy. Similar vote fractions can be produced at each stage in the tree, such as $\{p_{\mathrm{bar}}, p_{\mathrm{no~bar}}\}$, $\{p_{\mathrm{spiral}}, p_{\mathrm{no~spiral}}\}$ and $\{p_{\mathrm{odd}}, p_{\mathrm{not~odd}}\}$. Selecting a sample of galaxies with a specific feature using these vote fractions becomes a trade off between purity and completeness. Since not every user will submit a response to a 2nd, 3rd or 4th tier question (see Figure~\ref{fig:gztree}), the number of classifiers recording a response must be considered, in order to reduce noise in cases where only a small number of people answered that task. 

For example imagine that a galaxy is classified by $40$ people, $38$ of whom say that the galaxy is mostly smooth in answer to the first question. However, $2$ people decide that the galaxy is featured and/or has a disc, both of whom subsequently respond to Task 2 to say that there is a sign of a bar in the same galaxy. This would give a $p_{\rm{bar}}=1$, despite the fact that the $p_s = 0.95$. This is an unlikely situation, but highlights the need for not only consideration of the number of respondents for a task but also the vote fractions of previous tasks when using a threshold to identify a subset of features. Appropriate values for these thresholds given the number of respondents are shown in Table~\ref{table:votes} (reproduced from Table 3 in \citealt{GZ2}) and are adopted where relevant throughout this study.

\caption[Thresholds for selecting sub-samples of galaxies using GZ2 data]{Thresholds for determining well-sampled galaxies in GZ2. Thresholds depend on the number of respondents for a task, including the thresholds that should be applied to previous task(s) for both 10 and 20 respondents. As an example, to select galaxies that may or may not contain bars, cuts for $p_\mathrm{features/disk}>0.430$, $p_\mathrm{not~edgeon}>0.715$, and $N_\mathrm{not~edgeon}\geq20$ should be applied. No thresholds are given for Tasks 01 and 06, since these are answered for every classification in GZ2. The task numbers are those defined in Figure~\ref{fig:gztree}.}

\end{table}

All previous Galaxy Zoo projects have also incorporated extensive analysis of volunteer classifications to measure classification accuracy and bias. A weighting is computed for each user based on their classification history and agreement with the crowd in order to produce debiased vote fractions (for a detailed description of debiasing and consistency-based user weightings, see either Section 3 of \citealt{Lintott09} or Section 3 of \citealt{GZ2}). This produces highly accurate and robust detailed morphological classifications and is a significant statistical improvement over efforts completed using only a small number of expert classifiers \citep{schawinski07, nair10b, ann15}. These classifications can now be used as machine learning training sets \citep{dieleman15} to improve future automated classifications of galaxies. 

The debiased GZ2 $p_d$ and $p_s$ vote fractions encompass the continuous spectrum of morphological features (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mosaic}), rather than a simple binary classification separating elliptical and disc galaxies (see Section~\ref{sec:bigpic}). These classifications allow each galaxy to be considered as a probabilistic object with both bulge and disc components. I utilise the debiased GZ2 vote fractions in this study to facilitate future work studying more detailed galaxy structures.

I require a sample of galaxies with optical and NUV photometry from SDSS and GALEX respectively, along with morphologies from GZ2 in order to study the morphological dependence of galaxy quenching histories. Starting with the $304,022$ SDSS galaxies in the GZ2 sample, objects considered to be stars or artefacts in Task 0 or merging pairs in Task 6 (using the thresholds defined in Table~\ref{table:votes}) were removed. Further to this, I required NUV photometry from the GALEX survey, within which $\sim42\%$ of the GZ2 sample galaxies were observed, giving a total sample size of $126, 316$ galaxies. This will be referred to as the \textsc{gz2-galex} sample. 

The completeness of the \textsc{gz2-galex} sample is shown in Figure~\ref{complete} with the $u$-band absolute magnitude against redshift, compared with the SDSS data set. Typical Milky Way $L_*$ galaxies with $M_u \sim -20.5$ are still included in the GZ2 subsample out to the highest redshift of $z \sim 0.25$; however dwarf and lower mass galaxies are only detected at the lowest redshifts.

Galaxy colours were not corrected for intrinsic dust attenuation. This is of particular consequence for disc galaxies, where attenuation increases with increasing inclination. \cite{Buat05} found the median value of the attenuation in the GALEX NUV passband to be $\sim 1$ mag. Similarly \cite{masters10a} found a total extinction from face-on to edge-on spirals of 0.7 and 0.5 mag for the SDSS $u$ and $r$ passbands and show spirals with $\log(a/b) > 0.7$ have signs of significant dust attenuation. For the \textsc{gz2-galex} sample I find $\sim29\%$ of discs (with $p_d > 0.5$) have $\log(a/b) > 0.7$, therefore we must be aware of possible biases in the results due to dust. 

I shall use the \textsc{gz2-galex} sample to probe how different quenching mechanisms cause galaxies of different morphologies and environments to transition from the SFS to quiescence. 


\section{Thesis Summary}\label{sec:thesissum}


This thesis proceeds as follows. In Chapter~\ref{chap:starpy} I describe the SFH model used to characterise the colours of quenching galaxies, along with the statistical methods used to determine the distribution of quenching histories in a population of galaxies. In Chapter~\ref{chap:morph} I apply this method across the red sequence, green valley and blue cloud and investigate the morphological dependence of quenching histories in these populations. Chapter~\ref{chap:agn} is split into two parts. In Section~\ref{sec:agnfeedback} I investigate the effect of AGN feedback on the quenching histories of a  population of AGN host galaxies. In Section~\ref{sec:intbulgeless} I investigate the proposed slow co-evolution of galaxies with their central black holes, by measuring the black hole masses of a sample of bulgeless galaxies, which have assumed merger free histories. In Chapter~\ref{chap:env} I return to investigating the quenching histories of galaxies, this time focussing on the effect of the group environment on satellite galaxies in comparison to centrals and those in the field. In Chapter~\ref{chap:discussion} I discuss how the implications of my results in the context of galaxy evolution and propose ideas for future work.

Where necessary I adopt the Planck 2015 cosmological results \citep{planck16} with $(\Omega_m, \Omega_{\lambda}, h) = (0.309 \pm 0.006, 0.691 \pm 0.006, 0.677 \pm 0.005)$.
