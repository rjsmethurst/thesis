\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:intro}

Understanding the physical processes which shaped our Universe is the fundamental goal of all fields in astrophysics. A theory of the Universe must describe how it evolved from the primordial soup of matter present just after the Big Bang to the whole host of galaxy properties we see today. 

At the time of writing, the most widely accepted model is the $\Lambda-\rm{CDM}$ ($\Lambda-$ cold dark matter) model which describes a flat Universe made of only $\sim4\%$ baryonic (``normal'') matter, $\sim21\%$ cold dark matter and $\sim71\%$ dark energy \citep{planck16}. In such a Universe, tiny quantum fluctuations in the early Universe grow with time, becoming overdense and lay the foundations for galaxy formation. Given the very small fraction of baryonic matter in the Universe, its gravitational contribution to this process is often neglected, greatly simplifying the problem. Structure is then observed to form hierarchically in simulations \citep{citebomb}. At the overdense regions in the early Universe, matter collapses dissipationally under its own gravity forming a dark matter `halo', which then grows through smooth accretion and mergers of other halos to produce the large scale structure of galaxy filaments, clusters and voids we observe today. 

Adding in the complex baryonic physics into this picture however, complicates matters. Galaxies are, unfortunately, not just simple smooth dark matter halos; they are thought to start life when baryons cool and condense at the centre of a dark matter halo. Further accretion of circum-nuclear gas then forms a rotating disc, within which stars will form as hydrogen gas coalesces and a galaxy is born. From this moment a galaxy will evolve, its shape changing depending on its encounters (or lack thereof) with other galaxies. 

Today we observe galaxies of a multitude of shapes, or morphology, across all redshift ranges. \cite{hubble36}  was the first to classify galaxies based on their shape, producing the widely adopted `tuning fork diagram', now known as the Hubble sequence and shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hubble}. Hubble noticed that galaxies could by broadly categorised as either elliptical in shape or as a disc with spiral arms and barred structures. He referred to these categories as early-types (and put them to the left of his diagram, in keeping with time axis conventions) and late types respectively, as he thought that as galaxies evolved they developed spiral structure. However, as discussed above, cosmological studies have concluded that galaxies start life as a rotating gas disc and so instead Hubble's diagram is often read from right to left. Connecting this picture of pure gas disc galaxies in their infancy, with this plethora of galaxy structure we see today, is the focus of this thesis.

\end{figure}

Like all difficult problems however, the structure alone is not enough to describe a galaxy's evolution. The magnitude (used as a proxy for stellar mass), star formation rate (SFR), metallicity (Z) and environment are all crucial to describing a galaxy's current state. By studying these galaxy properties, insight into the processes which govern galaxy evolution can be gained.

Large scale surveys of galaxies have firstly revealed a bimodality in the optical colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) finding two distinct populations; one at relatively low mass, with blue optical colours and another at relatively high mass, with red optical colours \citep{Baldry04, Baldry06, Willmer06, ball08, Brammer09}. These populations were dubbed the `blue cloud' and `red sequence' respectively \citep{Chester64, bower92, Driver06, Faber07}.  The sparsely populated colour space between these two populations was dubbed the  `green valley'.

The majority of disc galaxies were found in the blue cloud and the majority of ellipticals on the red sequence, with colour often used as a proxy for morphology. The Galaxy Zoo project \citep{Lintott11}, which produced morphological classifications for a million galaxies, helped to confirm that this colour bimodality is not entirely morphology driven \citep{Strat01, Salim07, Sch07, CHV08, Bamford09, Skibba09}, detecting larger numbers of spiral galaxies in the red sequence \citep{masters10c} and elliptical galaxies in the blue cloud \citep{Sch09} than had previously been detected.

Secondly large galaxy surveys revealed that star forming galaxies are also observed to lie on a well defined `star forming sequence' (SFS) in the stellar mass vs. star formation rate (SFR) plane. The majority of blue cloud galaxies are found to lie on this SFS with the majority of the red sequence lying well below it with very low SFRs. The intermediate colours of the green valley have therefore been interpreted as evidence of recent suppression of star formation \citep[SF;][]{Salim07}. This suppression of SF and subsequent transition of a galaxy from blue cloud to red sequence must therefore also be intrinsically tied with a possible change in morphology from a disc galaxy to an elliptical galaxy.

Green valley galaxies have therefore long been thought of as the `crossroads' of galaxy evolution, a transition population between the two main galactic stages of the star forming blue cloud and the `dead' red sequence \citep{Bell04, Wyder07, Schim07, Martin07, Faber07, Mendez11, Gonc12, schawinski14, Pan14}. This transition is theorised to occur on rapid timescales, otherwise there would be an accumulation of galaxies residing in the green valley, rather than an accumulation in the red sequence as is observed \citep{Arnouts07, Martin07}.

I will refer to this suppression of a galaxy's SFR as \emph{quenching} and processes which can cause this suppression as \emph{quenching mechanisms}. By studying these galaxies which are quenching, having just left the SFS sequence, the mechanisms governing large scale galaxy evolution, including both the suppression of SF and the possible transformation of galaxy structure, can be probed. 

\section{Possible quenching mechanisms}\label{sec:quenchmech}

There are many theorised mechanisms which can cause quenching. They are often referred to as either \emph{internal} mechanisms (caused by the galaxy's \emph{nature}) or \emph{external} mechanisms (caused by the way the galaxy is \emph{nurtured}). The properties of a galaxy and its environment are often thought to control which mechanisms will affect a galaxy throughout its lifetime and subsequently affect the morphology. 

%There have been many previous theories for the initial triggers of these quenching mechanisms, including negative feedback from AGN \citep{diMatteo05, Martin07, Nandra07, Sch07}, mergers \citep{Darg10a, Cheung12, Barro13}, supernovae winds \citep{MFB12}, cluster interactions \citep{Coil08, Mendez11, Fang13} and secular evolution \citep{masters10c, masters11a, Mendez11}. By investigating the \emph{amount} of quenching that has occurred in the blue cloud, green valley and red sequence; and by comparing the amount across these three populations, I can apply some constraints to these theories. 
\subsection{Internal Quenching Mechanisms}\label{sec:intquench}

\subsubsection{AGN feedback as a quenching mechanism}\label{sec:agnquench}

An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is an actively growing supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy. AGN feedback is one of the most investigated mechanisms of quenching due to the tight correlations between properties of galaxies and their black holes \citep{magorrian98, marconi03, haringrix04}. This implies that the formation energy of the black hole and galaxy are coupled, leading to a co-evolution of galaxies with their black holes. This suggests that changes in the SFR and structure of a galaxy could also be tied to the black hole. 

The output of energetic material and radiation generated by the accretion onto the black hole is theorised to either heat or expel gas needed for SF in a galaxy, causing a quench. AGN feedback was first suggested as a mechanism for regulating star formation due to the results of simulations \citep{silk98, Bower06, Croton06, somerville08} wherein galaxies could grow to unrealistic stellar masses. Without a prescription for the effects of AGN feedback, the shape of the galaxy luminosity function could therefore not be matched at the high luminosity end \citep{baugh98, baugh05, kauffmann99a, kauffmann99b, somerville01, kitzbichler06}. A similar problem was also encountered at the low end of the luminosity function, which was rectified by the inclusion of the effects of supernova wind feedback \citep{dekel86, powell11}.

Indirect observational evidence has now been found for both positive and negative feedback in various systems (see the comprehensive review from \citealt{fabian12}). The strongest of which is that the largest fraction of AGN are found in the green valley \citep{cowie08, Hickox09, schawinski10a}, suggesting a link between AGN activity and the process which moves a galaxy from the blue cloud to the red sequence. However, concrete statistical evidence for the effect of AGN feedback on the host galaxy population has so far been elusive.


\subsubsection{Mass quenching}\label{sec:massquench}
Mass quenching is the process by which a galaxy, independent of its environment, uses up its available gas for star formation via the Kennicutt-Schmidt law \citep{schmidt59, kennicutt98} and consequently grows in mass. As it does so there is less gas available for SF, and so in effect quenches itself \citep{peng12}. This is thought to be the dominant mechanism for isolated galaxies in the field \citep{kormendy04}. However, it is also thought that in groups and cluster environments, infall into the group can occur over long timescales during which gas reservoirs can be depleted via this mass quenching process.
 
\subsubsection{Morphological quenching}\label{sec:moprhquench}
Morphological quenching (or `secular' quenching, referring to slow, non-violent processes) is the process by which the internal structure of a galaxy can impact on its own SFR (essentially shooting itself in the foot). This is theorised to occur in galaxies hosting bars; the bar funnels gas to the centre of the galaxy \citep{athanassoula92a} where it is exhausted by star formation effectively quenching the galaxy \citep{zurita04, sheth05}. 

Such a process has been postulated to be caused also by bulges \citep{bluck14} whereby the large gravitational potential of the bulge prevents the disc from collapsing and forming stars \citep{Fang13}. Recent observational evidence from \citep{hart16} also suggests that spiral structure can also cause morphological quenching. \citeauthor{hart16} propose that many armed spiral structures can trigger galaxy wide starbursts thereby using up gas for future star formation; similarly two armed spirals are observed with redder colours, suggesting that this spiral phase is much longer lived and may funnel gas into the centre of the galaxy to be exhausted in star formation.  
  
\subsection{External Quenching Mechanisms}\label{sec:extquench}
  
\subsubsection{Mergers as a quenching mechanism}\label{sec:mergersquench}

Major mergers have been intrinsically linked to the formation of elliptical galaxies since \citet{toomre72} showed this was possible with a simulation of the merger of two equal mass disc galaxies.

In denser environments, galaxies are more likely to encounter another galaxy in a merger or interaction scenario than when isolated in the field environment. When two galaxies merge, the influx of cold gas funnelled by the forces in the interaction often result in energetic starbursts and the fuelling of a central AGN \citep{hopkins05}, both of which can exhaust  (and in the case of the AGN possibly expel) the gas required for star formation, effectively quenching the post-merger remnant galaxy \citep{pontzen16}. 

\subsubsection{Environment driven quenching}\label{sec:envquench}

The environment of a galaxy has long been considered a key  \emph{nurturing} aspect of galaxy evolution. Correlations of galaxy morphology \citep{dressler80, smail97, poggianti99, postman05, Bamford09}, colour \citep{butcher78, pimbblet02} and the quenched galaxy fraction \citep{kauffmann03, Baldry06, peng12, darvish16} with the environmental density all suggest that the environment is in some way responsible for the build up of the red sequence through quenching. 

The proposed quenching mechanisms under the umbrella of environmental quenching are numerous and varied. Together with the typical gravitational galaxy-galaxy interactions \citep{moore96} expected to be more frequent in a dense environment, environmental quenching also includes hydrodynamic interactions occurring between the cold inter stellar medium (ISM) of the in-falling galaxy and the hot intergalactic medium (IGM) of the group or cluster. Such hydrodynamic interactions include ram pressure stripping \citep{gunngott72}, viscous stripping \citep{nulsen82}, and thermal evaporation \citep[a rapid rise in temperature of the ISM due to contact with the IGM;][]{cowie77}. Another such process is starvation \citep{larson80} which can remove the outer galaxy halo cutting off the star formation gas supply to a galaxy. Preprocessing occurs when all of the above mechanisms take place in a group of galaxies which then merges with a larger cluster \citep{dressler04}. 

The most likely candidate (and therefore the most studied) mechanism for the cause of the environmental density-morphology and SFR relations is ram pressure stripping \citep[RPS;][]{abadi99, poggianti99}. However, there has been mounting evidence that RPS may not be as effective as a quenching mechanism as first thought \citep{emerick16, fillingham16}, therefore investigations of other environmentally driven quenching mechanisms are having a recent resurgence.

\section{Data}\label{sec:data}

\subsection{SDSS}\label{sec:sdssintro}

The galaxy sample is compiled from publicly available optical data from the Sloan Digitial Sky Survey (SDSS; \citealt{York00}) Data Release 8 \citep{Aihara11}, which provides optical colours across $5$ broadband filters, $ugriz$. 

Observed optical petrosian magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction \citep{Oh11} by applying the \citet*{Cardelli89} law, giving a typical correction of $u-r \sim 0.05$. K-corrections are also adopted to $z=0.0$ and absolute magnitudes obtained from the NYU-VAGC \citep{Blanton05, padmanabhan08, blanton07}, giving a typical $u-r$ correction of $\sim 0.15$ mag. The change in the $u-r$ colour due to both corrections therefore ranges from $\Delta u-r \sim 0.2$ at low redshift, increasing up to $\Delta u-r \sim 1.0$ at $z \sim 0.25$, which is consistent with the expected k-corrections shown in Figure 15 of \citet{blanton07}. These corrections were calculated by \citet{Bamford09} for a subset of galaxies in the SDSS survey. These corrections are a crucial aspect of this work since a $\Delta u-r \sim 1.0$ can cause a galaxy to change whether it is class as blue cloud, green valley or red sequence.

Star formation rates and stellar masses, where available, were obtained from the MPA-JHU catalog \citep{kauffmann03, brinchmann04}. I used the average values, \textsc{AVG SFR} and \textsc{AVG MASS}, which are corrected for aperture effects and extinction.

We further select a sub-sample with detailed morphological classifications, as described below,  to give a volume limited sample in the redshift range $0.01 < z < 0.25$.


\subsection{GALEX}\label{sec:galexintro}

Near-ultraviolet (NUV) photometry was obtained from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX; \citealt{Martin05}) and was matched with a search radius of $1''$ to the SDSS data in right ascension and declination. GALEX images galaxies simultaneously in two broadband filters: both the far ultra-violent (FUV) with an effective wavelength of $1,516\rm{\AA}$ and $4''$ resolution and in the NUV with an effective wavelength of $2,267\rm{\AA}$ and $5.6''$ resolution. The {\tt auto} magnitudes provided by the GALEX pipeline are used in this study (for a discussion of aperture bias between different surveys see \citealt{hill11}). All magnitudes are k-corrected and extinction corrected as described in Section~\ref{sec:sdssintro}.

\subsection{Galaxy Zoo}\label{sec:GZ}

Galaxy Zoo (GZ) is a citizen science project enlisting the help of thousands of members of the public to voluntarily classify SDSS galaxy images online\footnote{\url{http://galaxyzoo.org}}. The first version of GZ classified just under 1 million galaxies as either ellipticals, spirals or mergers within 6 months of launch \citep{lintott08, Lintott11}. In the second version, GZ2, users were asked to make more detailed morphological classifications of $304, 022$ images from the SDSS DR8 (a subset of those classified in the first Galaxy Zoo; GZ1). These images were all classified by \emph{at least} 17 independent users, with the mean number of classifications standing at $\sim42$. GZ is now in its ninth year of classifying and its fifth incarnation, after classifying images from Hubble Space Telescope Legacy surveys in GZ:Hubble \citep{willett16} and the CANDELS survey galaxies in GZ:CANDELS \citep{simmons16}. At the current time of writing images from the DeCALS\footnote{\url{http://legacysurvey.org/}} survey and Illustrius simulation \citep{vogelsberger14, genel14} are being classified by users. 

\begin{figure}
\centering{
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{introduction/gz2_tree.pdf}}
\caption[GZ2 classification decision tree]{Flowchart of the classification tree for GZ2, beginning at the top with Task 0. Tasks are colour-coded by their relative depths in the decision tree with tasks in green, blue and purple respectively one, two or three steps below branching points in the decision tree.}
\label{fig:gztree}
\end{figure}

Since GZ2 all projects have collected classification data via a multi-step decision tree, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gztree}.  Each individual step in a tree is a \emph{task}, which consists of a \emph{question} with a finite number of possible \emph{answers}. The selection of an answer is called the user's \emph{vote}. The first task of GZ2 asks users to choose whether a galaxy is mostly smooth, is featured and/or has a disc or is a star/artefact. Unlike other tasks further down the decision tree, every user who classifies a galaxy image will complete this task (others, such as whether the galaxy has a bar, is dependent on a user having first classified it as a featured galaxy). Therefore the most statistically robust classifications are available at this level.

% The Galaxy Zoo 2 (GZ2) project consists of $304, 022$ images from the SDSS DR8 (a subset of those classified in Galaxy Zoo 1; GZ1) all classified by \emph{at least} 17 independent users, with the mean number of classifications standing at $\sim42$. The GZ2 sample is more robust than the GZ1 sample and provides more detailed morphological classifications, including features such as bars, the number of spiral arms and the ellipticity of smooth galaxies. It is for these reasons I use the GZ2 sample, as opposed to the GZ1, allowing for further investigation of specific galaxy classes in the future. 

The classifications from users produces a vote fraction for each galaxy; for example if 80 of 100 people thought a galaxy was featured and/or had a disc, whereas 20 out of 100 people thought the same galaxy was mostly smooth (i.e. elliptical), that galaxy would have raw vote fractions $p_{sd} = 0.8$ and $p_{d} = 0.2$. In this example this galaxy would be included in the \emph{`clean'} disc sample ($p_d \geq 0.8$) according to \cite{GZ2} and would be considered a late-type galaxy. Similar vote fractions can be produced at each stage in the tree, such as $\{p_{\mathrm{bar}}, p_{\mathrm{no~bar}}\}$, $\{p_{\mathrm{spiral}}, p_{\mathrm{no~spiral}}\}$ and $\{p_{\mathrm{odd}}, p_{\mathrm{not~odd}}\}$. Selecting a sample of galaxies with a specific feature using these vote fractions becomes a trade off between purity and completeness. Also since not every user will submit a response to a 2nd, 3rd or 4th tier question, the number of classifiers recording a response must be considered to reduce noise in cases where only a small number of people answered that task. 

For example imagine that a galaxy is classified by $40$ people, $38$ of whom say that the galaxy is mostly smooth in answer to the first question. However, $2$ people decide that the galaxy is featured and/or has a disc, both of whom subsequently respond to Task 2 to say that there is a sign of a bar in the same galaxy. This would give a $p_{\rm{bar}}=1$, despite the fact that the $p_s = 0.95$. This is an unlikely situation, but highlights the need for not only consideration of the number of respondents for a task but also the vote fractions of previous tasks when using a threshold vote fraction to identify a subset of features. Appropriate values for these thresholds given the number of respondents are shown in Table~\ref{table:votes} (reproduced from Table 3 in \citealt{GZ2}) and are adopted where relevant throughout this study.

No thresholds are given for Tasks 01 and 06, since these are answered for every classification in GZ2. The task numbers are those defined in Figure~\ref{fig:gztree}.}
\label{table:votes}
\end{table}

All previous Galaxy Zoo projects have also incorporated extensive analysis of volunteer classifications to measure classification accuracy and bias. A weighting is computed for each user based on their classification history and agreement with the crowd (for a detailed description of debiasing and consistency-based user weightings, see either Section 3 of \citealt{Lintott09} or Section 3 of \citealt{GZ2}). This produces highly accurate and robust detailed morphological classifications and is significant statistical improvement over efforts completed using only a small number of expert classifiers \citep{schawinski07, nair10b, ann15}. These classifications can now be used as machine learning training sets \citep{dieleman15} to improve future automated classifications of galaxies. 

The GZ2 $p_d$ and $p_s$ vote fractions encompass the continuous spectrum of morphological features (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mosaic}), rather than a simple binary classification separating elliptical and disc galaxies (see Section~\ref{sec:bigpic}). These classifications allow each galaxy to be considered as a probabilistic object with both bulge and disc components. I utilise the GZ2 vote fractions in this case to facilitate future work studying more detailed galaxy structures.

I require a sample of galaxies with optical and NUV photometry from SDSS and GALEX respectively, along with morphologies from GZ2 in order to study the morphological dependence of galaxy quenching histories. Starting with the $304,022$ SDSS galaxies in the GZ2 sample, objects considered to considered to be stars or artefacts in Task 0 or merging pairs in Task 6 (using the thresholds defined in Table~\ref{table:votes}) were removed. Further to this, I required NUV photometry from the GALEX survey, within which $\sim42\%$ of the GZ2 sample were observed, giving a total sample size of $126, 316$ galaxies. This will be referred to as the \textsc{gz2-galex} sample. 

The completeness of the \textsc{gz2-galex} sample is shown in Figure~\ref{complete} with the $u$-band absolute magnitude against redshift, compared with the SDSS data set. Typical Milky Way $L_*$ galaxies with $M_u \sim -20.5$ are still included in the GZ2 subsample out to the highest redshift of $z \sim 0.25$; however dwarf and lower mass galaxies are only detected at the lowest redshifts.

Galaxy colours were not corrected for intrinsic dust attenuation. This is of particular consequence for disc galaxies, where attenuation increases with increasing inclination. \cite{Buat05} found the median value of the attenuation in the GALEX NUV passband to be $\sim 1$ mag. Similarly \cite{masters10a} found a total extinction from face-on to edge-on spirals of 0.7 and 0.5 mag for the SDSS $u$ and $r$ passbands and show spirals with $\log(a/b) > 0.7$ have signs of significant dust attenuation. For the \textsc{gz2-galex} sample I find $?\%$ of discs (with $p_d > 0.5$) have $\log(a/b) > 0.7$, therefore we must be aware of possible biases in the results due to dust. 

I shall use the \textsc{gz2-galex} sample to probe how different quenching mechanisms cause galaxies to transition from the SFS to quiescence.
