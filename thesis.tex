\begin{originality}
The work presented in this thesis was carried out by me at the Department of Astrophysics, Univeristy of Oxford between October 2013 and December 2016, under the supervision of Prof. Chris Linttot. It was funded by a Science Technology Failities Council Studentship Grant Code ST/K502236/1. I hereby declare that no part of this thesis has been submtted in support of another degree, diploma or other qualification at the University of Oxford or other higher learning insitute. Except where otherwise stated or where reference is made to the work of others, the work in this thesis is entirely my own.

The work in Chapters~\ref{chap:starpy} \& \ref{chap:morph} is based on the peer-reviewed, published paper \citealt{smethurst15}, \mnras, 450, 435, of which I am the lead author. Similarly, Section~\ref{sec:agnfeedback} is based on the peer-reviewed, published paper \citealt{smethurst16}, \mnras, 463, 2986, of which I am the lead author. 

The work presented in Section~\ref{sec:intbulgeless} was carried out in collaboration with Dr. Brooke Simmons and Prof. Chris Linttot and is in preparation for submission to \mnras.

The work throughout this thesis relies on observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Funding for SDSS-III has been provided by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Participating Institutions, the National Science Foundation, and the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science. The SDSS-III web site is http://www.sdss3.org/.

%SDSS-III is managed by the Astrophysical Research Consortium for the Participating Institutions of the SDSS-III Collaboration including the University of Arizona, the Brazilian Participation Group, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Florida, the French Participation Group, the German Participation Group, Harvard University, the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias, the Michigan State/Notre Dame/JINA Participation Group, Johns Hopkins University, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics, Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, New Mexico State University, New York University, Ohio State University, Pennsylvania State University, University of Portsmouth, Princeton University, the Spanish Participation Group, University of Tokyo, University of Utah, Vanderbilt University, University of Virginia, University of Washington, and Yale University.

The work throughout this thesis is based on observations made with the NASA Galaxy Evolution Explorer. GALEX is operated for NASA by the California Institute of Technology under NASA contract NAS5-98034. 

This thesis made extensive use of the Tool for Operations on Catalogues And Tables \citep[TOPCAT;][]{taylor05} and the {\tt astropy} Python module \citep{astropy13}. This research has also made use of NASA’s ADS service and Cornell’s ArXiv.

The copyright of this thesis rests with the author. No quotation from it or information derived from it may be published without the prior conesnt and acknowledgement of its author.
