\chapter{The influence of the group environment}\label{chap:env}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
 
 So far, I have considered  galaxy mergers, interactions, morphology and AGN as causes of quenching across the galaxy population. While it is abundantly clear that these mechanisms can strongly affect the SFHs of galaxies, the density of a galaxy's environment is thought to be the largest influence on the evolutionary path the galaxy can take. 
 
 The galaxy environment as a cause of quenching was proposed due to the correlation of morphology \citep{dressler80, smail97, poggianti99, postman05, Bamford09}, star formation rate (SFR) and the quenched galaxy fraction \citep{kauffmann03, Baldry06, peng12, darvish16} with environmental density. Star forming disc galaxies tend to be located in low-density environments with quiescent elliptical galaxies in more dense environments. Although these correlations were originally interpreted as causation, recent evidence from simulations suggests that the environment may not be the dominant quenching mechanism in the galaxy lifecycle \citep{ref, ref} with \citet{Skibba09} suggesting that the morphology-density relation is mostly due to the colour-density relation as seen in \citet{pimbblet02}. Perhaps instead, the correlation of increased galaxy quenched fractions with environment is due to a superposition of the effects of mergers \& interactions and both mass \& morphology quenching. 
  
In order to isolate the cause of the density-morphology and density-SFR correlations, I need to observe how morphology and galaxy quenching timescales change in group environments with different properties in comparison to the field. Here, I use the group environment to tackle this problem, as this is a more typical environment for a galaxy than the relatively rare rich cluster environment \citep{carlberg04}. I construct a sample of both group and field galaxies and once again use \starpy\ to determine the quenching time and rate to describe a simple SFH for a galaxy given its photometry. However, dense environments are messy with many factors at work, whose effects are difficult to discern. These individual mechanisms effects would be washed out across the population density distributions produced by \textsc{popstarpy} and so I do not employ this method in this Chapter. 

Instead, I have simplified the analysis in order to separate the effects of the different quenching mechanisms contributing to the galaxy population in the group environment. I aim to determine the following: (i) How does the environment influence the detailed morphological structures of a galaxy?  (ii) Is quenching which is directly caused by the environment occurring in galaxy groups?
 
 
%In Section~\ref{sec:data} I describe the group catalog employed and highlight the results in Section~\ref{sec:results}. 
 
\section{Data and Methods}\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Group Identification}\label{sec:groups}

The selection of a robust cluster or group catalog is a thesis in itself, with many studies attempting this across the SDSS \citep{} and other large surveys \citep{}. Difficulties arise in removing projection effects, understanding the selection function used, covering large ranges in mass and redshift, and dealing with spectral fibre collisions \citep[see comprehensive review by][for in depth discussion]{postman02}. Various different methods have been employed to achieve robust group identification including clustering algorithms \citep[e.g.][]{miller05}, galaxy colour modelling \citep{koester07}, adaptive filter halo modelling \citep{yang05, yang07} and friends-of-friends algorithms \citep{goto05, merchan05, berlind06}. 

Each group finding algorithm has to be tested for purity (how contaminated the groups are by non-members) and completeness (how often are true members excluded from a group). \citet{campbell15} compared the purity and completeness of two of the most frequently used group catalogs of \citet[][a friends-of-friends algorithm]{berlind06} and \citet[][a halo modelling algorithm]{yang07} and concluded that no sample could achieve perfect purity or completeness. Despite the different algorithms employed to identify group galaxies in the two catalogs, \citeauthor{campbell15} found that the two catalogs are remarkably similar; however the \citeauthor{yang07} catalog has higher purity of satellites at lower halo masses (i.e. the low halo mass groups are less contaminated by non-members). For this reason the \citeauthor{yang07} is the most commonly used catalog across environment studies using the SDSS \citep{citationbomb}, however I find that when cross matched with the \textsc{gz2-galex} sample (with a $3``$ search radius) only $38$ galaxies (of $176,604$ galaxies with more than 2 galaxies in a group) are identified. This is most likely due to the necessity for GALEX NUV photometry. 

Instead I therefore use the \citet{berlind06} catalogue, which uses a friends-of-friends algorithm to identify group and cluster galaxies in the SDSS. This was cross matched to the \textsc{gz2-galex} sample and limited to $z < 0.1$ (to ensure GALEX completeness of the red sequence; see \citealt{wyder07, yesuf14}) to give $14,199$ group galaxies. Centrals were selected as the most massive galaxy in a group \citep[as in][]{yang07, yang09, pasquali10} with all other galaxies in a group designated as satellites and the number of galaxies in a galaxy's group, $N_{group}$ was recorded. 

The projected group centric radius, $R$, of all satellite galaxies was calculated from the projected separations of the co-ordinates of a satellite from its central; this was then converted to $\rm{kpc}$ from a consideration of the observed redshift of the central galaxy. In order to compare groups of different sizes, the virial radius is often used as a normalisation constant to this projected group centric radius. Here I use a proxy to the virial radius \citep[see][]{navarro95}, $R_{200}$, the radius within which the group mass overdensity is 200 times the critical density, $\rho_{\rm{crit}}(z)$, as defined by \citealt{finn05}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:overdense}
200\rho_{\rm{crit}}(z) = \frac{M_{cl}}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R_{200}^3}
\end{equation}

where $M_{cl}$ is the mass of the group. \citeauthor{finn05} then use the $z$ dependance of the critical density and the virial mass to relate the line-of-sight velocity, $\sigma_x$, to the group mass so that $R_{200}$ becomes:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:r200}
R_{200} = 1.73 \left ( \frac{\sigma_x}{1000 \rm{km}~\rm{s}^{-1}} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_{\Lambda} +\Omega_o(1+z)^3}} ~ h_{100}^{-1} ~\rm{Mpc}, 
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_x$ is the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of a group. This was calculated from the proper velocities of each galaxy, $i$ as defined in \cite{danese80}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:propervel}
v_i = c \cdot \frac{z_i - z_{group}}{1 + z_{group}}.
\end{equation}
The line-of-sight velocity dispersion, $\sigma_x$, was then calculated for a group as the standard deviation of the velocity dispersions $\sqrt{(v_i - \left< v_i\right>)^2}$. These calculations resulted in a sample of $3,468$ centrals and $10,731$ satellites within a projected group centric radius range of $0 < R/R_{200} < 25$ and $z < 0.084$ which shall be referred to as the \textsc{gz2-berlind} sample. Note that for a galaxy (central or satellite) to be included in the \textsc{gz2-berlind} sample, the rest of its group does not, however the properties of that group are still retained by the included galaxy. 

Unlike in previous Chapters, here I will specifically focus on galaxies that are below the star forming sequence (SFS). I therefore select galaxies that are $1\sigma$ below the SFS, giving $4,629$ satellite and $2,314$ central galaxies which will collectively be referred to as the \textsc{gz2-group} sample. These galaxies are shown in the panels of Figure \ref{fig:sfrmass} and can be seen to lie below the SFS of star formation. 

\begin{figure}

\label{fig:sfrmass}
\end{figure}


I also compare the \textsc{gz2-berlind} and \textsc{gz2-group} samples with a measurement of the projected neighbour density, $\Sigma_N = N/4\pi d_N^2$, from \cite{Baldry06} where $d_N$ is the distance to the $N^{\rm{th}}$ nearest neighbour. $\Sigma$ is a more direct probe of the local density of a galaxy's environment, and although it does not allow of the identification of groups and their properties it is still a useful probe of the local density inside a group  \cite[see][for a comparison of various environment parameterisations]{muldrew12}.

In this work I use the estimates of \cite{Bamford09} of a local galaxy density, $\Sigma$, determined by averaging $\log\Sigma_N$ for $N = 4$ and $N=5$. $90\%$ of the \textsc{gz2-berlind} sample have $\log\Sigma > -0.8$ (the threshold quoted by \citealt{Baldry06} below which field galaxies are found), suggesting high completeness of the group sample. The distributions of $\log\Sigma$ for star forming and quenching/quenched centrals and satellites in the \textsc{gz2-berlind} sample are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sigmadist}. Star forming galaxies tend to reside in less dense local environments than their quenching/quenched counterparts. The satellite galaxies as a whole also seem to occupy denser local environments than centrals, however on investigation this seems to arise because the satellites in the \textsc{gz2-berlind} sample reside in groups with larger $N_{group}$ than the centrals. This is once again likely due to the necessity for GALEX colours.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Field sample}\label{sec:field}

For all galaxies in the \textsc{gz2-galex} sample, I calculated the smallest projected group centric radii, $R/R_{200}$, from each of the central galaxies in the \citet{berlind06} catalog (regardless of whether a central was included in the \textsc{gz2-berlind} sample) and selected candidate field galaxies as those with (i) $R/R_{200} > 25$ and (ii) $\log\Sigma < -0.8$ \citep[the threshold on the local environment density which selects field galaxies as defined by][]{Baldry06}. I chose to use both of these environmental density measures ensure a pure sample of candidate field galaxies.

This sample of field galaxy candidates was then matched in redshift and stellar mass firstly to the central galaxies of the \textsc{gz2-group} sample to give $2,309$ field galaxies with $z < 0.084$ which will be referred to as the \textsc{gz2-cent-field} sample. In this work I shall focus on galaxies which are either quenching or quenched and are more than $1\sigma$ below the SFS. This encompasses $1,596$ field galaxies with $z < 0.084$ which will be referred to as the \textsc{gz2-cent-field-q} sample. It will be used as a control sample when investigating the trends with central galaxy properties of the inferred quenching parameters. The redshift distribution of the \textsc{gz2-cent-field-q} sample is shown in comparison to the distribution of central galaxies in the \textsc{gz2-group} sample in left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:zcompare}. %SDSS images of a random selection of galaxies from the \textsc{gz2-group} and \textsc{gz2-cent-field-q} samples are shown ordered by their GZ2 debiased vote fraction in Figure~\ref{fig:mosaic}. %KS test between samples?

Secondly, the field galaxy candidates were then matched in redshift and stellar mass to the satellite galaxies of the \textsc{gz2-group} sample to give $5, 004$ field galaxies with $z < 0.084$ which will be referred to as the \textsc{gz2-sat-field} sample. These galaxies in the \textsc{gz2-sat-field} sample will be used as a control when investigating the morphological trends of satellite galaxies with environment. Note that the sample is not restricted to being $1\sigma$ below the SFS in this case. The redshift distribution of the \textsc{gz2-sat-field} sample is shown in comparison to the distribution of satellite galaxies in the \textsc{gz-group} sample in the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:zcompare}

We obtain SFRs and stellar velocity dispersions of galaxies for all of the field samples described above from the MPA-JHU catalogue \citep{kauffmann03, brinchmann04}.

\subsection{Morphological fractions}\label{sec:morphfrac}

I once again utilise the GZ2 vote fraction to quantity the morphology of galaxies in the \textsc{gz2-group} sample, in order to investigate the morphological trends with group radius. As in previous Chapters, I shall utilise $p_{\rm{disc}}$ and $p_{\rm{smooth}}$ but will also use $p_{\rm{bar}}$, $p_{\rm{bulge}}$ and $p_{\rm{merger}}$ to calculate the bar, bulge and merger fractions in the \textsc{gz2-group} sample respectively. 

Fractions are calculated considering the number of barred ($p_{\rm{bar}} > 0.5$; see \citealt{masters11a, cheung13}) and bulged ($p_{\rm{bulge}} > 0.5$) galaxies over the number of disc galaxies ($p_{\rm{disc}} > 0.43$, $p_{\rm{edge\_on, no}} > 0.715$, $N_{\rm{edge\_on, no}} > 20$; see Table~\ref{table:gz2thresholds}, originally printed in \citealt{GZ2}) in the \textsc{gz2-group} satellite sample. The merger fraction considers the number of merging galaxies ($p_{\rm{merger}} > 0.4$; see \citealt{darg10a}) over the number of galaxies in the \textsc{gz2-group} satellite sample. 

\subsection{Time since quenching}\label{sec:delta}

The SFHs of all galaxies in both the \textsc{gz2-group} and \textsc{gz2-field} samples were analysed using \starpy\; the output of \starpy\ is probabilistic in nature, providing the posterior probability distribution across the two-parameter space for an individual galaxy. Whereas in Chapters~\ref{chap:morph} \& \ref{chap:agn} the \textsc{popstarpy} method was used to combine and weight the individual distributions to give an overall distribution representing the population of galaxies, due to the complex nature of the group environment, in this Chapter I instead take the 50th percentile walker position of an individual posterior probability distribution to give the most likely $t_{q}$ and $\tau$ for each galaxy. \

This simplifies the output from \starpy  ~for each galaxy from a probability distribution to just values, with uncertainties which encode the information about the shape of the individual galaxy's SFH posterior probability distribution. In this Chapter I will look for trends in the time since quenching onset, $\Delta t$, for a given galaxy by calculating {\bf $\Delta t = t_\mathrm{obs} - t_{q}$}. I will observe how this quantity changes with group properties, including the halo mass, velocity dispersion, number of group members and relative velocity of a satellite galaxy. 


\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Mass dependance with radius}

Since morphological features have been shown to be dependent on the stellar mass of a galaxy \citep[e.g. the increase in the bar fraction with stellar mass; see][]{nair10, skibba12}, before investigating trends in the morphology with group radius in the \textsc{gz2-group} sample, the mass dependence on the group radius must be considered. This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:massdep}. The average mass is roughly flat and consistent with the median field value with increasing group radius, until the most central group radius bin at $R \sim 0.01~R_{200}$. This trend is present for both morphologies, with early-type galaxies showing a larger increase in the average stellar mass. This trend with stellar mass should be kept in mind as a potential bias to the results presented in the following sections.

\label{fig:mergerradius}
\end{figure}


I perform an initial sanity check on the \textsc{gz2-group} sample by recreating the morphology-density relation \citep{dressler80} in Figure \ref{fig:morphradius}, which shows the mean disc and smooth vote fractions as a function of group radius. The mean disc vote fraction decreases from the mean field value (blue line) under $1$ virial radius, in agreement with previous studies on the morphology-density relation \citep{dressler80, smail97, poggianti99, postman05, Bamford09}. The extensive morphological classifications provided by GZ2 also allow for the investigation of how more detailed morphological structure is affected by the group environment.  

Figure \ref{fig:barradius} therefore  shows how the bar fraction (number of barred disc galaxies over the number of disc galaxies) increases towards the centre of the group population, significantly over the field fraction (blue solid line). Figure \ref{fig:mergerradius} shows how the merger fraction does not significantly deviate from the field fraction (blue solid line) until within a virial radius. As discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:agn}, mergers are thought to grow bulges and so similarly, Figure~\ref{fig:bulgeradius} shows how galaxies with dominant or obvious bulges are more common in the inner regions of the group. 

%Figure \ref{fig:sfrradius} shows how the SFR of the \textsc{gz2-group} sample does indeed decline with decreasing group centric distance, significantly below the mean SFR of the \textsc{gz2-field} sample shown by the blue dashed line. This is in agreement with the results of \cite{gomez03} who observe a similar decline in SFR with group centric radius in SDSS clusters (see for example, Figure 6 in \citealt{gomez03}). This coincides with the morphological fraction changes seen in Figures~\ref{fig:morphradius}-{\ref{fig:merger radius} in support of the conclusions of \citet{smethurst15} that quenching is morphologically dependent.

\label{fig:timesinceradiusvel}}
\end{figure}

With the output from \starpy~ I look at the trends in the time since quenching onset ($\Delta t = t_{obs} - t_{q}$, see Section \ref{sec:delta}) and quenching rate, $\tau$, with group radius, $R/R_{200}$ for satellite galaxies and central galaxies in the \textsc{gz2-group} sample, compared with galaxies in the \textsc{gz2-field} sample. This is shown across Figures \ref{fig:timesinceradius} - \ref{fig:timesinceradiusvel} wherein the \textsc{gz2-group} sample is binned by various group properties. All bin thresholds were chosen to give approximately the same number of galaxies in each bin. Note that this does not ensure the same number of galaxies will be found in each $R/R_{200}$ bin. 

Across all the left panels in Figures~\ref{fig:timesinceradius} - \ref{fig:timesinceradiusvel} a general trend for increasing time since quenching onset with group radius can be seen. As earlier in Section \ref{sec:resmorph}, in Figures \ref{fig:morphradius}$-$\ref{fig:bulgeradius} significant differences from the field averages arise inside $\sim$ one virial radius. However, no trend with group radius is seen for the rate at which quenching occurs for galaxies in the \textsc{gz2-group} sample (right panels Figures~\ref{fig:timesinceradius} - \ref{fig:timesinceradiusvel}). This suggest that whatever mechanisms causes quenching in a given galaxy will do so at the same rate in both dense and sparse environments. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradius}a the \textsc{gz2-group} sample is split by stellar mass, $M_*$, and a clear trend for increasing time since quenching onset with increasing stellar mass for satellite, central and field galaxies can be seen. However, this trend is less apparent for the rate of quenching seen in Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradius}b. The central galaxies (shown by the square points at $\sim 0.01 R/R_{200}$) appear to have quenched more recently than the inner satellites (at $\sim0.1R/R_{200}$) of the same mass but at the same quenching rate. 

In the bottom panels of Figure \ref{fig:timesinceradius} I split the \textsc{gz2-group} sample by halo mass by using the corresponding central galaxy of a group, $M_{c,*}$ as a proxy. I find a clear trend for increasing time since quenching onset with increasing stellar mass of the group central for satellite, central and field galaxies (Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradius}c) but once again this trend is less apparent for the rate of quenching (Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradius}d) suggesting the halo mass does not affect which quenching mechanism acts upon either central or satellite galaxies. 

To account for the effects of conformity \citep[i.e. that satellites of higher mass tend to be found in higher mass halos]{citationbomb} I also split the satellites of the \textsc{gz2-group} sample by the stellar mass ratio of the satellite to it's central galaxy, $\mu_* = M_*/M_{*,c}$, in the bottom panels of Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradiusmu}. $\Delta t $ increases more steeply with projected group centric radius (particularly beyond $\sim$ a virial radius; Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradiusmu}c) for satellite galaxies with much smaller masses than their group central ($-2.0 < \log_{10}\mu_* < -0.75$, shown by the blue curve). Once again this is not the case of the rate that quenching occurs, as show in Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradiusmu}d. 

Another property of the group which is expected to affect the satellite quenching histories is the number of group members, $N_{group}$. The top panels of Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradiusmu} show that there is no trend with time since quenching onset or rate of quenching with increasing $N_{group}$ for satellite galaxies. The central galaxies (shown by the square points at $\sim 0.01 R/R_{200}$) however, do show a trend for increasing time since quenching as the number of group galaxies increases (Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradiusmu}a), but the rate at which they quench is the same (Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradiusmu}d).

In the top panels of Figure \ref{fig:timesinceradiusvel} the \textsc{gz2-group} satellite galaxies are split into bins of their relative velocity to their central galaxies, i.e. the speed at which they move through the dense group environment. There is no trend with either time since onset of quenching (Figure \ref{fig:timesinceradiusvel}a) or rate of quenching (Figure \ref{fig:timesinceradiusvelb}) with increasing relative velocity for galaxies in the \textsc{gz2-group} sample.

The bottom panels of Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradiusvel} show the trend with group radius for the \textsc{gz2-group} satellites when split into bins of galaxy stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_*$ (note that this is not the velocity dispersion of the group). The stellar velocity dispersion shows the largest trend in $\Delta t$ (Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradiusvel}c) for satellite galaxies of all of the group properties studied, with galaxies with the smallest stellar velocity dispersions having quenched more recently. Although this trend is less apparent in Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradiusvel}d for the rate that quenching occurs with $\sigma_*$, it is the largest trend see across the right panels of Figures ~\ref{fig:timesinceradius}-\ref{fig:timesinceradiusvel}. Also, field galaxies (shown by the circles at $\sim 25 R/R_{200}$) with low velocity dispersions are seen to quench at much slower rates than their satellite counterparts.


\section{Discussion}\label{sec:disc}

\subsection{The role of mergers in quenching in the group environment}\label{sec:rolemergerenv}

The merger classification in GZ2 has been shown to preferentially identify major mergers \citep{Darg10a}; whereas, bulge formation in disc galaxies is often associated with (minor) merger driven evolutionary histories \citep{croton06, tonini16}.  Although we see evidence for an enhanced merger fraction in the inner regions of the group environment in Figure~\ref{fig:mergerradius}, the bulge fractions in Figure~\ref{fig:bulgeradius} vary much more significantly from the field value than the merger fraction. This suggests that minor mergers may be more dominant than major mergers in the group environment, particularly at $R/R_{200} > 0.5$. 

If mergers are the dominant evolutionary mechanism for satellite galaxies, as the morphological evidence in Figures~\ref{fig:mergerradius} \& \ref{fig:bulgeradius} suggests, we would expect to see a difference in the quenching histories of satellites residing in groups with a larger number of members. However, the top panels of Figure \ref{fig:timesinceradiusmu} show there is no trend with time since quenching onset or rate of quenching with increasing $N_{group}$ for the satellite galaxies. This suggests that mergers are not the dominant quenching mechanism for satellite galaxies, but that whatever mechanism is the cause of the quenching occurs at the same rate irrespective of group size. 

Central galaxies however do show a trend for increasing time since quenching with increasing $N_{group}$  (square points at $0.01 R/R_{200}$ in Figure \ref{fig:timesinceradiusmu}a) at a rate of $\tau \sim 1 \rm{Gyr}$, which as discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:morph} was attributed to mergers and galaxy interactions which could transform a galaxy's morphology. Therefore, the larger the number of group members, the more important mergers are for a central's evolutionary history. This is in agreement with the findings of \citet{lin10, ellison10, lidman13} and also \citet{mcintosh08} who found in a sample of local groups and clusters that half of the mergers they identified involved the central galaxy. \cite{liu09} also found that the fraction of merging centrals increases with the richness of a cluster (a measure of the number of galaxies within $1h^{-1}\rm{Mpc}$ of the central galaxy).

This idea is supported by the result in Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradius}a showing that centrals of a given mass have quenched more recently than the inner satellites (at $\sim0.1R/R_{200}$) of a given mass. This suggests that an episode of more recent star formation, such as a starburst, may have occurred in the central galaxies but not in the inner satellites. Mergers are thought to case an energetic burst of star formation which can in turn quench the remnant galaxy \citep[][as discussed in Section \ref{rapid}]{hopkins05, treister12, pontzen16}. This result is once again suggestive of a merger dominated history for central galaxies. 

\subsection{The role of mass quenching in the group environment}\label{sec:rolemassenv}

A trend is seen for increasing time since quenching with increasing stellar mass and velocity dispersion for centrals, satellites and field galaxies in Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradius}a and Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradiusvel}c respectively. This is suggestive of mass quenching occurring across the entire galaxy population irrespective of environmental density, supporting the work of \citet{peng10, peng12, Gabor10} and \citet{darvish16}.

\subsection{The role of morphological quenching in the group environment}\label{sec:rolemorphenv}

The increasing bar fraction toward the central group regions  shown in Figure \ref{fig:barradius}, is consistent with results that show that bars themselves may be the cause of morphological quenching through the funnelling of gas toward the central regions of galaxies \citep{athanassoula92b, sheth05,masters10c} which is then used in star formation, exhausting the available gas. A discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:agn}, an inflow dueto a bar may also be able to fuel an AGN. The AGN-environmental connection has been extensively with conflicting results; \cite{pimbblet13}, with optically selected AGN, and \cite{elhert14}, with X-ray selected AGN, showed that the AGN fraction decreases towards the inner regions of groups. However, these studies did not take into account the morphology-density relation of satellite galaxies, where bugle dominated galaxies dominate in the inner regions of groups. \cite{miller03} and more recently \cite{desouza16} using a hierarchical Bayesian method showed with optically selected AGN that although the AGN fraction decreases with group radius for early-type galaxies, it stays constant with group radius for late-types. This suggests that disc galaxies are still able to fuel their AGN even in dense environments. We must therefore consider whether the environment itself may play a role in triggering the disk instabilities which can produce a morphological bar. Indeed harassment and tidal interactions have been shown to both promote and inhibit bar formation dependent on the stellar mass \citep{noguchi88, moore96, skibba12}.  If the environment was indeed triggering a bar, then morphological quenching would be occurring in the group environment but indirectly due to environmental quenching. 

\subsection{The role of the environment in quenching}\label{sec:roleenv}

Across all panels of Figures~\ref{fig:timesinceradius}-\ref{fig:timesinceradiusvel} a trend for increasing time since quenching onset with decreasing projected group centric radius is present. I interpret this as the environment directly causing quenching at the same rate throughout the infall time of a galaxy in a group. Those galaxies closer in, fell into the group earlier and as they did so they started to quench, giving rise to a larger inferred $\Delta t$.

The results in the bottom panel of  Figure \ref{fig:timesinceradius} suggest more massive halos therefore have a greater impact on the star formation histories of their satellites than less massive halos. The stellar mass of the central galaxy is used as a proxy for halo mass which is correlated with both (i) the gravitational potential of the group \citep{ref} and (ii) the temperature of the IGM \citep{ref}.

It is thought that higher mass halos have hotter intra group medium (IGM) temperatures \citep{ref} which can then have a greater impact impact on a galaxy through RPS of cold gas \citep{ref}. \cite{gunngott72} define the ram pressure as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rps}
\rho_{\rm{IGM}}\cdot v^2 = 2\pi G \cdot \sigma_*(R) \cdot \sigma_g(R),
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{\rm{ICM}}$ is the density of the IGM, $\sigma_*(R)$ the star surface density and $\sigma_g(R)$ the gas surface density of the galaxy disc. Therefore if ram pressure stripping is indeed a dominant environmental quenching mechanism we should see a trend in $\Delta t$ with the speed a galaxy moves through the IGM relative to it's central galaxy.  However in the top panel of Figure \ref{fig:timesinceradiusvel} we see that this is not the case. This therefore rules out RPS as the dominant environmental quenching mechanism, in support of the conclusions of simulations by \citet{emerick16, fillingham16} and observations by \citet{mcgee14}. Although this conclusion may be due to the stellar mass range spanned by the \textsc{gz2-group} satellite galaxies which have $M_* \geq 10^9 \rm{M}_{\odot}$, as simulations by \cite{fillingham16} suggest that RPS only becomes effective at $M_* \leq 10^{8-9} \rm{M}_{\odot}$. 

Above this mass threshold in the simulations of \cite{fillingham16}, a galaxy `starvation' mode \citep{larson80, balogh90} is dominant, where galaxy's extended gaseous halos are removed from which cold gas for star formation can be fed to the galaxy. Such a mechanism will be correlated with the group potential and the galaxy potential; galaxy's with lower potential will be most easily stripped of their halos. This is apparent in Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradiusvel}d where satellites with lower velocity dispersion (a proxy for the galaxy potential) are more rapidly quenched than their field and higher velocity dispersion counterparts. The dominant environmental quenching mechanism occurring in the group environment must therefore be correlated with the group potential. This suggests that satellite galaxies may be most affected by gravitationally driven environmental effects, such as strangulation or thermal evaporation of the galaxy halo and galaxy harassment. 

If we assume that galaxies begin their infall into a group at a radius of $\sim10\rm{R}_{200}$ we can calculate the infall time of the satellites from the difference in $\delta t$ from a radius of $0.1 \rm{R}_{200}$, $\delta \Delta t = \Delta t_{0.1R_{200}} - \Delta t_{10 R_{200}}$. In Figure~\ref{fig:timesinceradiusmu}

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}

Using the \citet{berlind06} group catalog, I have constructed a sample of group galaxies in the SDSS which were cross matched with Galaxy Zoo 2 and GALEX in order to determine their most likely SFHs using \starpy. Have shown that although mass quenching, mrphological quenching and merger are all important mechanisms at work in quenching the galaxies in the group environment, the environment doe still l play a role in quenching. My finds are summarised as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Mergers
 
\item Mass quenching
 
 \item Morphological quenching
 
 \item Environmental quenching
 
\end{enumerate}
